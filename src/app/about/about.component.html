<h1>About</h1>
<p>I have been doing this since 2011.</p>
<p>I make websites and web applications.</p>
<p>I specialize in open source web technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>
  I mostly work in Angular on a day to day basis, but I also enjoy making simple
  marketing websites.

  I believe in simplicity and functionality produce a pleasant user experience.

  I focus my main role as a <strong>UI/UX Frontend Developer</strong> in most
  development projects.
